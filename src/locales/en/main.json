During the summer we will continuously improve the design and functionality, and add things that are currently missing compared to the old website. By the way, it can still be used at old.fsektionen.se. Since we have also replaced the server and the backend, the new and old systems are separated: if you have old car bookings, room bookings, settings, accounts, etc. they will not be available through the new web and you will have to make new ones. Some things e.g. the image gallery, are transferred but may not have the GUI available yet. NOTE! We plan to get rid of the old website in the near future (preferably before the introduction period), so please try to use the new one as much as possible. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact the webmasters via spindelman@fsektionen.se.",
