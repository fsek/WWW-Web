			"q6": "What do the colors mean?",
			"a6": "Different colors show status and ownership for each booking. An admin (the car foreman) must confirm bookings outside regular hours. The colors have the following meaning:\n- Light orange color means it's your booking, but it's not confirmed.\n- Dark orange color means it's your booking and it's confirmed.\n- Green color marks someone else's confirmed booking.\n- Yellow color shows someone else's unconfirmed booking.\n- Light blue color is used for bookings that have been added locally but haven't been retrieved from the server yet. If you see blue, something may have gone wrong, reload the page manually.",

			"a7": "You can contact the car foreman through, among other ways, the <0>contact page</0>. Please ask the car foreman or a webmaster to add the question with an answer here."
