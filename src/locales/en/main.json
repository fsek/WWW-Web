			"a2": "As activities are suspended during the summer, it is not easy to rent the guild's car. Contact the board (at) fsektionen.se to ask if it can be solved.",
			"q3": "How many people can fit in the car?",
			"a3": "The car can accommodate up to 7 people, including the driver.",
			"q4": "What is the cargo capacity of the car?",
			"a4": "The trunk (with the rear seats folded) is approximately (with the reservation that it is not a perfect rectangle) 190 cm deep, 130 cm wide and 80 cm high.",
			"q5": "How much does it cost to rent the car?",
			"a5": "Members of the F-guild pay a starting fee of SEK 150. The starting fee includes 20 kilometers, after that it costs SEK 5 per kilometer started.",
			"q6": "What do the colours mean?",
			"a6": "Different colors indicate the status and ownership of each reservation. A light orange color means it is your booking, but not yet confirmed. A dark orange color shows that it is your confirmed booking. If the color is green, it indicates someone else's confirmed booking. A yellow color signifies someone else's unconfirmed booking. An admin (the car foreman) has to confirm bookings made outside regular hours."
