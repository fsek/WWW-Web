	"welcomeText": "We are currently in a transition period to our new website. During the summer we will continuously improve the design and functionality, and add things that are currently missing compared to the old website. By the way, it can still be used at old.fsektionen.se. Since we have also replaced the server and the backend, the new and old systems are separated: if you have old car bookings, room bookings, settings, accounts, etc. they will not be available through the new web and you will have to make new ones. Some things e.g. the image gallery, are transferred but may not have the GUI available yet. NOTE! We plan to get rid of the old website in the near future (preferably before the introduction period), so please try to use the new one as much as possible. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact the webmasters via spindelman@fsektionen.se.",

	"faq": {
		"self": "Questions answered",
		"q1": {
			"question": "Can I log in with my old account?",
			"answer": "No, since we switched to a new backend you need to create a new account. You can do that at fsektionen.se/register. There are many things you won't have access to until you create an account, verify your email, and become verified as a member."
		},
		"q2": {
			"question": "How do I become verified as a member?",
			"answer": "Create an account, verify your email, and add your Stil-ID (hi6122al-s) in the user settings (check the top right corner). After this, you will have to wait for the webmasters to check if you are a member or a bot (like a certain Anna I know). Membership verification is therefore automatic for you, but if you feel it takes too long you can contact your council boss."
		},
		"q3": {
			"question": "Noooo the app doesn't work anymore!!! What am I supposed to do with my life if I can't play moose game!??!?",
			"answer": "We will try to work on a new release of the app as soon as we can. Pretty much everything you can do there you can do on the new or old website. If you have problems, contact the webmasters."
		},
		"q4": {
			"question": "What do you still have left to move over?",
			"answer": "Quite a lot (the website is terribly large!). To look at pictures, book rooms, find advanced contact info, read governing documents or old documents we haven't uploaded yet, sing songs from the songbook, use the motion machine and elections in general you can use the old website. We will soon add event signup as well, until then you'll have to wait."
		},
		"q5": {
			"question": "Help! I don't have any of my old admin rights!",
			"answer": "Please wait or contact your council boss. Not all admin pages are ready, but we will be able to give you access to the ones that are as soon as possible."
