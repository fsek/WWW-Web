We are working to continuously improve the design and functionality, and add things that are currently missing compared to the old website. By the way, it can still be used at old.fsektionen.se. Since we have also replaced the server and the database, the new and old systems are separated: if you have old accounts, room bookings, settings, car bookings, etc. they will not be available through the new web and you will have to make new ones. NOTE! We plan to get rid of the old website in the near future, so please try to use the new one as much as possible.

		},
		"q2": {
			"question": "How do I become verified as a member?",
			"answer": "Create an account, verify your email, and add your Stil-ID (hi6122al-s) in the user settings (check the top right corner). After this, you must wait for us to verify that you are indeed a member. At the start of the semester, this may take longer than usual. If you feel that it is taking too long, you can contact your council boss or a mentor/föset during the introduction period."

To read the governing documents in their entirety (though they are available in the document archive if you know their names) or use the proposition machine (RIP), you can use the old website. We are working as diligently as possible to ensure that everything is available on the new website. 🧡"

Check the following: \n\nThat you really have verified your account (try fsektionen.se/verify). \nThat you are registered as a member. (look in account settings to check for both of these!) \nThat you are logged in to the correct account and have not created multiple accounts, for example one with your student email and another with your personal email. If you have more than one account and want to get rid of the bad one, contact spindelman@fsektionen.se via the email of the account you want to delete."
