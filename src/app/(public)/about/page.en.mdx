# About us
The programs at [Lund University](https://www.lu.se) are divided into different faculties,
where all engineering students belong to the faculty of engineering, [LTH](https://www.lth.se).
Each faculty within the university has a corresponding student union, i.e. a non-profit, statutory interest organization 
for students belonging to that faculty.

  <Image src={blueLandscapeTlth} alt="Teknologkåren vid LTH logo" className="w-1/5" />
</a>

In our case, it is the student union [Teknologkåren vid LTH](https://www.tlth.se), which has more than 8,000
members and works with educational monitoring, corporate relations, and recreation activities. 
Subordinate to the Teknologkåren are 11 [guilds](https://www.tlth.se/sektioner) divided according to the different educational programs belonging to LTH.
The guilds are, in turn, independent non-profit organizations that work for students at a more local level but are also linked to Teknologkåren.

The F-guild consists of students from the following programs.
* *Master of Science in Engineering Physics (F)*
* *Master of Science in Engineering Mathematics (Pi)*
* *Master of Science in Engineering Nanoscience (N)*
* *Master's programme in Machine Learning, Systems and Control (MMSR)*
* *Master's programme in Photonics (MFOT)*
* *Master's programme in Nanoscience (MNAV)*


To become a member of the F guild, you must be studying (or have studied within the last two years) one of the programs above, as well as  [be a member of the Teknologkåren](https://www.tlth.se/bli-medlem), which costs SEK 500 
for a five-year membership.

## Operations 
The F-guild's activities are divided into different units, the main ones being the board, 
the audits, the nomination committee, and [the committees](https://fsektionen.se/councils).
All involvement is voluntary and based on official assignments in the form of positions that all members have the opportunity to apply for once per semester.
The guild does everything from monitoring education in each individual program in the form of course evaluations to formal dinners with parties afterwards!

Many committees organize events for members, such as a classic sitting, while others work internally with the guild's resources, such as implementing all the functions of the website.
The range of events is wide, and the guild strives to ensure that there is something for everyone!

In addition to its weekly activities, the guild also works long-term with everything from equality and sustainability plans to analyses of the labor market and corporate collaborations.

## Guildspaces
The F guild is located in Mattehuset (Sölvegatan 18, 223 62 Lund), in the middle of LTH Campus. 
Here you will find a lounge, microwaves, and a nice place to hang out. Mattehuset also houses Hilbert Café, which we run, where you can buy good coffee, baguettes, and salads, among other things.

## Channels of information
Our primary information channels are the [news feed](news) here on the website and our [Mattermost](https://mm.fsektionen.se) team, primarily in the Announcements and Announcements from the Board channels. To log in to Mattermost, you must first create an account here on the website and be
 manually verified as a member of the guild.

In addition to these channels, we also use social media as secondary and summary information channels, but also to showcase everyday activities at the guild.
