If you follow the steps in this program, you'll be able to make your first contribution in no time! Some of you have worked in groups on large projects before, while others are completely new to this way of working and these systems. If you don't understand something in these tasks, you might want to search unfamiliar terms online, ask a chatbot, or ask one of the su-permen so we can give you help with the whole context. If a task seems trivial to you, that's great! Feel free to skip it and move on to the next step. The goal is to get you comfortable and confident in contributing to our projects no matter what level you start from.",

As a general rule, if you've spent more than 15 minutes trying to figure something out it's time to ask for help, but asking earlier is always better.",

We need more people here, so if you're unsure, this is a good choice! You don't need to be great at design or have a passion for graphical design to work on the frontend.\n- **Backend**: Work here is backend-focused. If you like working with databases and APIs, this is the choice for you! The backend is a little more focused on logic and covering edge cases than the frontend.\n- **App**: Like the web, work here is frontend-focused. Installation might be a bit tricky (we'll help you), but if you feel drawn to mobile development, this is the way to go!\n\nCan't decide? Ask a su-perman for more information about the different projects!",
