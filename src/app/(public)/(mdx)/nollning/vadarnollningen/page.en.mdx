# What is The Introduction?

To start studying in a new city is a big change. The life as a student in Lund and at LTH is filled with possibilities to explore your interests, network and learn new things, but it can also feel overwhelming to do on your own. That's why we have the Introduction- to create a context within which you can get to know both Lund, the student life and lots of new people.

The Introduction runs over your entire first month as a student at the F-guild and starts the 20th of August for exchange- and master students and the 25th of August for the rest. You will be divided into a mentor group consisting of around 25-30 new students and 9 mentors. Your mentors are students who have studied at least one year in one of the different programmes at the F-guild and are there to help and answer all of the questions that you might have.

#### What happens during the Introduction?

During the Introduction, many different activities and events will take place, such as games, study nights, inspiring lunch lectures held by different companies, parties and sittings with students from your own and other programs. All for you to get to know your fellow students and to learn about Lund and the student life.

#### Good things to keep in mind during the introduction:

During the first week of the Introduction, LTH has the so-called Reception Week which is intended to give you an introduction to the education and LTH, and your regular courses will not yet have started. Once the studies start, the orientation continues in parallel after school and on weekends, and it is important to try to keep up with the weekly planning in the courses. Even if the evenings are filled with various tempting activities, it is important to find time to sit with your books. Your school schedule may look quite empty sometimes, but the gaps are there for you to have time to work on assignments. Feel free to ask your mentors for study tips, and try to participate in the study evenings and practice sessions that are offered.

#### Costs

The first time in Lund can be expensive. Firstly, course literature costs money and there are many events during nollning. However, Nollning is designed so that as much as possible should be free and, in cases where this is not possible, at cost price. Tickets can be between 50 and 500 SEK each. It is also common to buy things related to student life that will last the duration of your studies. Many choose to buy a songbook (about 150 SEK), overalls (about 450 SEK) and a technologist's cap (about 700 SEK) during the initiation, which in total costs about 1300 SEK. But nothing related to the introduction is compulsory, and even if you refrain from buying overalls etc. you can always participate. If you think you will want to attend many events and buy, for example, an overall, it may be a good idea to set aside money in advance.

#### The Introduction is voluntary

Finally, it's important to remember that everything during introduction is completely voluntary. Sometimes there will be a lot of activities and it can be difficult to keep up with everything that happens. It's okay to stay at home and come back for a later activity. You are always warmly welcome to participate in the introduction to the extent that you want to.
