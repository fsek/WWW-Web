# Checklist - Things to do before you start

#### Activate your student account. 
It gives you access to all computer-related services at the university (this is very important). You should receive an email about this a few days after your second admission letter. More info [here](https://www.lu.se/studera/livet-som-student/it-tjanster-support-och-driftinfo/studentkonto). Save your login details to this account.

#### Check out your school schedule [here](https://cloud.timeedit.net/lu/web/lth1/).  
Make sure to click on "Mottagningsvecka LTH". To find your schedule, search for your student group. 
Engineering Physics: F1 and F1-intro
Engineering Mathematics: Pi1 and Pi1-intro
Engineering Nanoscience: N1 and N1-intro

#### Become a member of the Student Union. 
Without this you cannot participate in many of the events that are organized, and it is through the union that you get your student ID. You can become a member [here](https://www.tlth.se/bli-medlem). 

#### Become a member of [Studentlund](https://www.studentlund.se/). 
Studentlund is the organization that connects Lund's nations, which are student associations that organize clubs, pubs and many other fun activities. These are not directly connected to the student union TLTH. To be able to attend nation activities you have to be registered at a nation, where step 1 is to become a member via the website in studentlund and step 2 is to register under a nation once you are in Lund. You do this by going to the expedition at the nation you want to enroll in. 

#### Create an account here on the F-guild website, fsektionen.se. 
Here you will be able to find information about events and other things that happen in the section. From here you will also be able to sign up for events, create it as soon as you can so that we can add you to the mentor group.

#### Download the F-guild app. 
It is the easiest way to keep track of the schedule, events and everything section-related, both during and after the introduction. You can find it wherever you find apps, search for *F-guild*.

#### Apply for CSN 
Apply [here](https://www.csn.se/). Apply for a whole year at a time and do not forget to submit a study declaration at the start of the semester.

#### Get somewhere to live! 
The housing situation in Lund can be a bit tricky, but there are several places to look:
- [AF bostäder](https://www.afbostader.se/att-bo-hos-oss/soka-studentbostad/soker-du-studentbostad/) (requires membership of Studentlund). 
- Nations rents out both apartments and dorm rooms.
- [Michael Hansens Kollegium](https://www.mhklund.se/)
- Subletting via [bopoolen](https://bopoolen.nu/)
- Blocket and Facebook groups

#### Get home insurance 
No activities that take place after regular school hours are covered by school insurance. Make sure you take out home insurance to cover you in case of an accident.

#### Change your address on the [Swedish Tax Agency website](https://skatteverket.se/privat/folkbokforing/flyttanmalan.4.76a43be412206334b89800018531.html). 
It will be a shame if your nice new student card that comes in the mail ends up at the wrong address.

#### Get a bike
It's an incredibly good way to get around Lund. Tips on where to find this is the block or in the facebook group "Sell/Buy Stuff in Lund, Sweden". FB marketplace is also a good place to look. Be careful though as the sellers are usually aware that they have a good market before the start of the semester when many new students buy bikes. 

#### Get swish. 
It's an app for your cell phone that makes it easy to transfer money from person to person. In student life, you make a lot of small transactions. More info [here](https://www.swish.nu/faq/private/hur-skaffar-jag-swish).

#### Do you have Facebook? 
If so, you can like the pages "F-sektionen inom TLTH" and "Teknologkåren vid LTH". There you will constantly find information about the freshman year and studies at LTH. You can also join the facebook group ["F-sektionen"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/321244590962).

Big hugs and good luck!
