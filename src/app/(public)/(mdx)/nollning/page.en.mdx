Welcome to the F-guild and congratulations on your spot on the engineering program in engineering physics, engineering mathematics, or engineering nanoscience!



# What is the F-guild?


The programs at Lund University are divided into different faculties. As a engineering student, you belong to the Faculty of Engineering, LTH. 



As an LTH student, you can become a member of Teknologkåren, TLTH. Teknologkåren is your student body that works with educational issues and coordinates student life for all LTH students. 



Teknologkåren has ten different guilds, which are divided according to the different programs at LTH. The guilds are non-profit organizations that work with educational issues, organize events, and create a sense of community for their programs.



The F-guild is for students studying engineering physics, engineering mathematics, or engineering nanoscience. 



# The introduction



## What is the introduction?


Starting university is a big change that for many also means a new city and a new home. Life as a student in Lund and at LTH is full of opportunities to explore new interests, make new contacts, and learn new things. This can definitely feel overwhelming to take on, but that is precisely why the introduction exists. The introduction provides a context in which you can get to know Lund, student life, and, above all, a lot of new people.



## The introduction 2025


The introduction takes place during your first five weeks as a student at the F-guild and begins for international students on Thursday, August 21. Traditionally, there is a new theme each year, and this year's theme is an Introduction at the Roman Forum.



## Mentor group


As a new student, you will be assigned to a mentor group together with other mentees and mentors. Your mentors are older students at the F-guild who will be with you throughout the introduction and will help answer any questions you may have.



## What happens during the introduction?


During the introduction, there will be lots of different activities, such as parties, pubs, games, study evenings, lunch lectures from companies, dinners, and much more. Some events are exclusive to the F-guild, while others are organized for several different guilds and sometimes the entire Teknologkåren. The introduction offers an incredible number of fun events, but also ensures that you get into your studies and learn how to manage them.




## The introduction is completely voluntary


The guild’s and the Teknologkårens introduction is fully supported by LTH, but it is of course completely voluntary. You choose which events you want to participate in, but be sure to take advantage of the opportunity!



## Good to know before the introduction


During the first week of the introduction, LTH organizes a welcome week for new students. The welcome week is intended to give you an introduction to the program and LTH, so your courses do not start until the following week. Once your studies have begun, the introduction continues in parallel, but then on weekdays after school.



Even though the evenings are filled with various attractive activities, it is important to find time to sit down and focus on your studies. Your school schedule may look quite empty at times, but the gaps are there so that you can, for example, calculate the course assignments or process the content. Feel free to ask your mentors for study tips, and try to participate in the practice sessions and study evenings.



Some days consist of several activities, and then you can of course skip one event to participate in another later. The introduction can be intense, and you participate to the extent that you want to. But remember that many events require advance registration.



We who organize the introduction are called Föset, and if you have any further questions, you can email foset@fsektionen.se.



## Alcohol culture


Alcohol is present at some events during the introduction, but drinking is always voluntary. At the F-guild, we have strong policies against all types of harassment, including alcohol harassment.



## Costs


This initial period in Lund can be expensive. Course literature costs money, as do some of the events during the introduction. However, the introduction is designed to be as inexpensive as possible. It is also common to buy items early on that will last throughout your studies. Many choose to buy a songbook, overalls, and a technology cap, which can cost up to SEK 1,300 in total. However, no items related to the introduction are mandatory, and even if you decide not to buy overalls, you are still welcome. It may be wise to set aside some money before the start of your studies.



## Föset 


We who organize the introduction are a committee at the F-guild are called Föset or the introduction committee. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us! The easiest way to reach us is via email at foset@fsektionen.se. We look forward to welcoming you to the F-guild and LTH!

## Check your school schedule


Be sure to click on “Reception Week LTH.” To find your specific schedule, search for your student group. You can find the schedule on TimeEdit.


Engineering Physics: F1 and F1 Intro


Engineering Mathematics: Pi1 and Pi1 Intro


Engineering nanoscience: N1 and N1 intro



## Become a member of the Engineering Student Union


To participate in the introduction at both the F-guild and Teknologkåren, you must be a member, and it is through the union that you will receive your student ID. The membership fee is SEK 500 and is valid for your entire period of study. You can become a member here: https://www.tlth.se/bli-medlem



## Create an account on the F-guild website 


Here you will find information about events and other things happening at the guild . You will also register for events here, so create an account as soon as you can so that we can add you to your mentor group.



## Download the F-guild app! 


It's the easiest way to keep track of your schedule, events, and everything guild-related, both during and after the introduction. You can find it where apps are available, search for F-sektionen.



## Become a member of Studentlund 


Studentlund is the organization that connects Lund's nations, which are student associations that organize clubs, pubs, and many other fun activities. These are not directly linked to TLTH. 



## Become a member of a nation


After becoming a member of Studentlund, you can join a nation, and then you can take part in everything that happens at all nations. You become a member by visiting a nation on site during their registration periods.



## Find course literature 


There are many places where you can find course literature. Here are a few suggestions:


KFS Studentbokhandel, StudieCentrum LTH


Campusbokhandeln, central Lund.


Studentapan, online.



## Find somewhere to live! 


The housing situation in Lund can be a bit tricky, but there are several places to look. For example:


AF bostäder (requires membership in Studentlund).


The nations rent out both apartments and corridor rooms.


Michael Hansens Kollegium


Second-hand housing via bopoolen


Blocket and Facebook groups



## Take out home insurance 


No activities that take place after regular school hours are covered by the school's insurance. Make sure you take out home insurance that covers you in case of an accident.



## Change your address


It would be a shame if your new student card, which arrives in the mail, ended up at the wrong address. You can change your address on the tax agency's website.



## Get a bike! 


It's a great way to get around Lund. Tips on where to find one can be found on Blocket or in the Facebook group “Sell/Buy Stuff in Lund, Sweden.” Facebook Marketplace is also a good place to look. Be careful, though, as sellers are usually aware that they have a good market before the start of the semester when many new students buy bikes.
