# An Introduction at Forum Romanum
**Welcome to the F-guild** and Lund!

This year's introduction: An Introduction at Forum Romanum, starts on **August 25th**. The introduction then continues for approximately five weeks. One of your mentors will call you later in August and try to answer all the questions you might have before the start of school and the introduction.

The association FREJA organizes a meetup for girls and non-binary individuals on **August 24th (the day before the introduction) from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM** outside the student union building's auditorium. If you want to read more about FREJA, you can visit their website [here](https://www.frejalth.se/)!

Here you'll find lots of important information before your study start and the introduction:
- [Everything you need to know about the introduction](/nollning/vadarnollningen).
- [Checklists before study start](/nollning/checklist).

We who organize the introduction are [The Introduction Committee](https://fsektionen.se/councils/foset/). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us! You can reach us either via [email](https://old.fsektionen.se/kontakter/49) or [here](https://contact.fsektionen.se/) if you want to be anonymous.

We look forward to welcoming you to the F-guild and LTH!

Greetings, <br/>*The Introduction Committee*
