# Rooms for Contemplation

At Lund University, we understand that students have diverse needs and require spaces that cater to their individual well-being and academic success. To accommodate the diversity of the student body, the university offers Rooms for Contemplation – safe and serene spaces for students to collect their thoughts, meditate, engage in private prayer or simply catch a break from the demands of university life.

These spaces are also invaluable for neurodivergent students who may find the university environment overwhelming at times and need a tranquil space to regroup and recharge.

Rooms for Contemplation serves as safe havens for individuals of all backgrounds and beliefs, fostering inclusivity and well-being within our academic community.
