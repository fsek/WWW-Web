# Test page
Congratulations! You've reached the test file where lots of tests are happening!

## What's being tested here?

This page serves as a playground for various MDX features and GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function testFunction() {
  console.log("Testing, testing... 1, 2, 3!");
  return "All systems operational";
}
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Testing recursive functions
print(f"Fibonacci sequence: {[fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)]}")
```

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Syntax highlighting | ✅ | Working perfectly |
| Tables | ✅ | Clean and responsive |
| Task lists | ✅ | Non interactive checkboxes |
