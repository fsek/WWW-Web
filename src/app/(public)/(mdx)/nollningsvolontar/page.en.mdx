# Become an Introduction Volunteer

*How exciting that you want to get involved in the most fun event of the year, the Introduction 2025! 
Below, we've briefly summarized what the different voluntary positrons entail. What we think is important and what we expect from our introduction volunteers. If you’re unsure of anything just let us know, we’re happy to answer any questions!*

Here is the presentation from the english info meeting: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ybzVWYH0ZEC2iJ4zcK3DzCc3c_1OwMvfZRsA8a4tu7o/edit?usp=sharing 

When applying for a volunteer position, it is important to understand that you will be asked to put in the time it takes. We want you to keep that in mind and be willing and eager to help out. The idea, of course, is not for everyone to be at everything, things can happen and everyone needs to rest, but think twice before you apply.

### Group mentors

*When?*

- In the spring there are a couple of education sessions and some fun events. We also encourage you to hang out with your group on your own so that you get to know each other and create a great group from the start.

- During the Introduction, you are expected to be involved throughout the period. This does not mean that you have to attend every single event, but as a group you should make sure that there are always a few mentors around for the mentees to turn to. This means many evenings and weekends.

- Make sure you are able to answer questions and provide info.

*What do we expect from you?*

What the Introduction Committee expects is for you to be there. Working to make everyone feel welcome, comfortable and making friends. You'll be a safe point for the mentees. We also expect you to be in good contact with your fellow mentors and that you are flexible.

*Extra important?*

Work with your mentors to ensure that someone is always on hand and that everyone has time to be available when they need to.

Make sure you show that studying is important too!

**Contact mentor**

This means having closer contact with the Introduction Committee and relaying information between them and their fellow mentors. You can also be a point of contact to the other mentoring groups. In terms of time, this means the same as a regular mentor + one lunch meeting per week during the Introduction.

**International Mentor**

The same as a group mentor but for an international group of mentees, You will speak English with your group of mentors, both mentors and mentees. It is particularly important to introduce the international mentees to LTH, Lund and Sweden and to make them feel part of the F-section. The introduction starts about a week earlier for international students

### Mission mentors


*When?*

In the spring there are a couple of education sessions and some fun events. We also encourage you to hang out with your group on your own so that you get to know each other and create a great group from the start.

During the introduction you will be responsible for a building, practicing or craft night and hang out with mentees at a couple of sessions/other events starting in week 1.

*Below is a list of missions that have been included in previous Introductions, but exactly which missions are included varies from year to year:*

 - FLYING: All sections will go to Helsingborg with home-made flying vehicles and compete to get as close to Denmark as possible (one day we will get all the way there, we just know it).
 - The Introduction movie: The mission is to record a theme-accurate short movie which is then played for everyone on the last day of the introduction, before the Nollegasque. An Introduction movie mentor should have some movie making experience.
 - Nollesexet: The mission group gets to practice holding their very first sitting for the other mentees. The theme, the food, the drinks, everything is up to the mentees!
 - Revyn: The assignment is to create a themed Revy, with rewritten songs. It is performed on the last day of the introduction, before Nollegasque. 
 - Regattan: Each mission group builds a boat in a theme-like style and competes against the other guilds on the lake, the goal being to sink the other guilds' boats.
 - Cheer: The group will create a cheer routine of about 3 minutes and then compete against the other guilds for the best routine during the Introduction weekend. On top of that, Cheer usually gets to participate in some other events and spread their joy! Their mission is to know as many guild chants as possible and shout them across campus.
 - Nollympics: the group gets to plan and organize an event with fun competitions for the other mentees. Here, only creativity limits what you can come up with.
 - The Balloon trebuchet: The mission team constructs a Balloon trebuchet, aka a catapult for water balloons. Guilds then compete in accuracy with their Balloon trebuchet, using the guild's own Introduction Committee as the target… 
 - Boxcar: The mission is to build the finest, fastest, most stylish boxcar, and then show just how incredibly fast it is by competing on a track against the other guilds' cars.
 - Showdown: In the showdown mission, you'll get the chance to both stand on stage and craft whatever it takes to get the audience's attention! Here, all guilds compete against each other in a show with no lines, full of background music and effects, and lots of over-the-top acting. Lots of laughs and fun await, may the best section win! And as a bonus the show can't be more than 3.14 min long...
 - The Head of the Introduction Committee Obstacle Course: Each gouilds's mission team gets to build their own obstacle, which will then be assembled into an obstacle course for all the guilds Head of the Introduction Committee. On the day of the competition, you should of course be there to cheer on and support your Head of the Introduction Committee!
 - Waderloo: In the Waderloo mission, each guild builds its own monument in the theme of the introduction. Here, creativity is allowed to flow to create a real masterpiece, but the most important thing is that the monument is stable and durable as the last guild with standing monument is the winner! Be sure to protect the guilds monument and destroy the others, but don't be afraid to get a little wet along the way
 - Band: Together with the others in your group you will rehearse about three songs, and then play them live at a sitting. 

*In previous years, the timetable for completing the assignments has looked something like this:*

End of lv1: FlyING

End of lv2: Obstacle Course, Cheer, Boxcar, Balloon trebuchet, Regatta, Waderloo, Showdown

End of lv3: Nollesexet and Nollympics

End of lv4: Nollegasquen when the Revue and the Nolle film are shown

Even after the mission is complete try to make sure the group hang out.

*What do you do?*

Gives the mentees a chance to meet more people from the guild in addition to the mentor group.

Carry out the goal of the mission, which might include building a boxcar, putting together a Revy or shooting a movie.

*Extra important?*

Try to get as many people as possible involved in the mission to create a great group! At the same time, many people might want to study and no one should feel forced to deprioritize studying!
