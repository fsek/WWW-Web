# About Us

The F-guild within TLTH is a non-profit organization for students enrolled in one of the engineering programs: 
Engineering Physics, Engineering Mathematics, or Engineering Nanoscience. Its purpose is to promote camaraderie 
among members and to safeguard their common interests.

## The Math Building

The guild is located in the Math Building, where you'll find, among other things, a lounge, microwaves, 
and a great place to hang out. The Math Building also houses Hilbert Café, which we run. 
There you can buy tasty coffee, baguettes, and salads.

## Committees

The F-guild has a variety of committees, each led by a committee chairperson. Most chairpersons are
part of the guild’s board of operations, which handles the guild’s day-to-day activities. 
The Executive Board is the guild’s decision-making body and makes decisions on matters affecting the guild as a whole.

## Welcome!

As a member, you can choose to be highly active and engaged, moderately involved, or simply 
attend an occasional event. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out—see the [Contact](/contact) 
tab here on the website, or stop by the boardroom located in the southern part of the Hilbert corridor; 
there’s almost always an active guild member around.

We hope you’ll enjoy being part of the guild!
