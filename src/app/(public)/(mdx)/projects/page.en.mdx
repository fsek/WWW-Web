# Projects

How fun that you're thinking about starting a project! There are so many things you can do, and it all starts with an idea you have that you want to realize but might not have the resources for. It can sometimes seem a bit complicated and intimidating with all the rules you need to keep track of, but it's actually not that hard! Here's some information on how to get started if you're interested in doing a project! In the field next to this, there are ideas for projects that haven't started yet — are you interested in leading one of them? [Then contact the vice chairperson!](/contact)

Our guild has lots of equipment that's underutilized, and we can also support you financially. If you only need up to 500 SEK, just apply — need more than that? Don't hesitate to [contact the board](/contact) or the [vice chairperson](/contact), they can help you get the funding you need.

When applying, you should have a conversation with the vice chairperson to make sure everything is in order, and submit a completed project plan. If you have more questions, just [contact the vice chairperson](/contact).
