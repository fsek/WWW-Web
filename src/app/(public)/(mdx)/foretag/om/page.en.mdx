# About the F-guild

The F-guild currently consists of around 950 members who are talented students from the highly regarded master's degree programs in Engineering Physics, Engineering Mathematics and Engineering Nanoscience.

Our students are primarily educated in general, technical problem solving with a broad and varied base in areas such as physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, medicine, materials technology as well as systems and computer science. The students are trained in the ability to familiarize themselves with new and different problems. This could be interesting for diverse organizations and companies that value flexible employees.

The F-guild's business relations committee work with the goal to provide their students with insight into their future labor market as well as connections with potential employers. If you are interested in marketing yourself for or want to get in touch with our students, please refer to the following links:
