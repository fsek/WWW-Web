# Committees and other units

The F-guild's activities span several major areas, with each committee working
on a specific type of activity, such as *Sexmästeriet*, which organizes parties, or
*Studierådet*, which works with educational monitoring. The guild has more than ten different committees of varying
sizes, ranging from 5 to 45 officials. Smaller committees usually consist of a committee president and a few members
belonging to a single post, while larger committees may contain several subcommittees with several different positions and convening members for each subcommittee.

How and what each committee works with changes over time, and it is very common for a post in a committee to change or be merged with another post.
Committees can also have *volunteer positions*, which, unlike *official positions*, are often less demanding
and usually last for a shorter period of time. A common example are group- and missionmentors who are active during introduction and belong to *Föset*.

## Other units
In addition to the committees, there are several other units within the guild that are not classified as committees, these are:

* **The Board**: The guild's second highest decision-making body after the guild-assembly.
* **The Council of Operatives**: A coordination group consisting of most committee presidents.
* **The Management**: The Board + The Council of Operatives
* **External representatives**: Institutional representatives and program management members for the F guild's programs in various institutional boards belonging to LTH.
* **The Nomination Committee**: A nomination group for official positions with greater areas of responsibility, such as board positions and committee president posts.
* **Procession**: Group responsible for the guild's heraldic activities such as the *Order Dinner* and medals.
* **Audit**: Duo that reviews and monitors the work of the board and the guild's accounting.

## Projects and tasks
While the committees and other units engage in recurring and ongoing work, there are also 
projects and tasks that are shorter or temporary in nature. Examples of previous projects include:

* Alces Florentina - The F-guild Spring Ball 
* Ski trips to alpine resorts such as Val d'Isère, Val Thorèns, and Les Arcs
* New website
* Mooseguitar

A project can be about almost anything and can be granted a budget, premises, equipment, benefits, and other resources from the guild.
Applications are submitted to the *Presidium* (President and Vice President) by emailing a project plan with a designated project manager.
More information is available on the [Project page](https://fsektionen.se/projects).
